### Project Euler  
**project_euler.cpp** and **project_euler.h** solve [*Project Euler Problem 12*](https://projecteuler.net/problem=12)  
The code finishes running in ~42ms on an i7 10750H

### Rock Paper Scissors
**rock-paper-scissors.cpp** is just an overengineered terminal rock paper scissors player lol

very small big fibonacci number calculator in C
was too lazy to make a proper printing function the output is therefore not accurate
the two integers are interleaved in the same buffer for cache locality
finds the 200k'th fibonacci number in 1 second
